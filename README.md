<h2>Introducing<h2/>
I am a software developer who is enthusiastic about tackling challenging projects and tasks. My expertise encompasses a wide range of technologies, including front-end development (JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux jQuery), styling (CSS3, SASS/LESS, BEM), back-end development (Node.js, PHP, MySQL, MongoDB), markup (HTML5, Markdown), and UI/UX design (user experience, accessibility, inclusive design). I also possess good skills in version control (Git, GitHub).
<br/><br/>
Apart from my technical skills, I have hands-on experience with Agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban. I am well-versed with tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Pixelmator Pro, and Figma. I am also proficient in package management (npm, Yarn).
<br/><br/>
During my academic pursuits, I held the position of team leader.
<br/><br/>
Overall, I am a highly motivated and accomplished software developer with a diverse skill set and a proven track record of success. I am always on the lookout for new and exciting opportunities to learn and grow.
